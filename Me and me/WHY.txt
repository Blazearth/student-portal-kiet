I think I have figured out what I want to do for next 10 years in my career in life by the time  I turn 30
I have some dreams I want bring them to life of-course talking about it fills me with sense of anxiety and fear that it will not happen
whatever I write doesn't happen for me that's the fear but I think I am gonna take my writings as a challenge from now on I am most afraid of me where I will lead myself but in the end I have faith in me if push comes to shove I will be okay...

But that's not my point okay is mediocre If I am going to fail despite my soul telling me contrary I will fail like MAX
And If I win well that's what I hope happens for me so now what I want in next 10 years??

1)The version I see myself is the person going into google actually learning and leaning into tech and understanding things and nuances of it and then leave the country leave the scared boy behind this man leaving the country will be one genius kind he will have communication locked in he will have his career secured and locked in with good amount of savings so that I don't have to pretend or lie to myself and one good looking mf and is linguistic you know

2)Yes there I said it I want a job in google when I graduate from the college I feel it is the best place to learn and get myself validated.

3)After leaving the country maybe I will go on a year round trip of the country and world and have my family like happy for once not be a liability see the thing I have learnt is that i love my freedom and coolness and intellect and all but i also love to validate my father's belief in who i am and have my mother flex me...and for once it being true...i know it sounds very tragic and shitty that's what it is
