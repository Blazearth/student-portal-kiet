I FORGIVE YOU...I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING THOSE HABITS IN PLACE...IT'S ALRIGHTY..
I CAN'T FORGIVE MYSELF FOR HAVING NO PASSION FOR IT I WAS DOING IT BUT I HAD NO PASSION FOR IT AT ALL LIKE I WANTED TO BE THE BEST BUT THE PASSION WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS THE SELF PRESERVATION AND THE LOSING BECAME LIKE THE NEXT OBVIOUS CAN YOU IMAGINE ME

I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MY LIFE WILL WORK OR NOT 
BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS I HAVE KNOWN AND LEARNT FROM MOUNTAINS OF MY FAILURE
1)NOTHING NO PLAN IS IDEAL WHAT LOOKS WILL HAPPEN IN YOUR HEAD WON'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN SO PREPARE IN A WAY THAT U DON'T GET YOUR SWEPT
2)HABITS ARE WHAT'S GONNA WORK THE ETHIC IS EVERYTHING IT'S NOT THE GRIND THE HUSTLE BUT WAKING EVERYDAY FEELINK LIKE SHIT STILL SITTING IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN AND ACTUALLY MOVING YOUR FINGERS TO CODE IS WHAT WILL MAKE YOU AND THINKING ABOUT IT EVEN IF YOU FEEL LIKE CRYING NOT THE FAIRY BUT THE DIRTY BRUTAL BEGGING TYPE AND STILL DOING IT WILL BE OKAY 
3)ENJOYMENT IS NOT THE ENEMY AND NEITHER IS A WITHDRAWL FROM THIS WORLD DON'T FORGET THIS A WORLD OF PAIN WILL MAKE U 1D A WORLD OF JOY WILL MAKE YOU 1D
4)I HATE 1D 
5)PLEASE DON'T LET JEE HAPPEN AGAIN PLEASE MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT IF NOT GOOGLE IF NOT ANYTHING PLEASE SOMETHING DON'T BE FAILURE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE KNOWING THAT I AM A FAILURE I AM NOT JUST I LOST MY WAY WILL BE COOL I WILL FALL BUT BY CHOICE PLEASE GAURAV DON'T BE A FAILURE AS A ENGINEER OR A MAN PLEASE
6)PATIENCE IS COOL YOU KNOW WORK IN DEATH NONCHALANCE IN RESULT IS DAMN SEXY...
