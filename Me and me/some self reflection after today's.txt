some self reflection after today's shit that happened and then I can move on for starters I think who I want to be to get rid of this deep-s

I want to be a different person then I have been not conservative in my thinking nor judging book's by it's cover hell with that been accepting of myself and 
other people 
around me now what does that mean is I don't want to be like throwing anyone's opinion or thought out 
of window because I consider them something small and not that intelligent enough that is blindness.....
So being accepting of It is what I would like to do...

Now as of me talking about me I need to be more free from the fear of being judged can flirt openly randomly and can talk have conversation 
on the most common things politics life love career humor flirt reciprocating it and all of it....And even being me in the group
 just hanging out having fun with the people and trying to know them what drives what they think on and anything and everything else....

As of my love life I know I will find this very lovely girl with whom things will happen and it won't go down the drain i am 
pretty confident in that aspect of my life...question is will she approach or i will and that's the problem i haven't been straightforward enough 
i could be pretty straight forward with my life and be free no one is going to judge me or question and to hell with that if i am accepting of
everyone else why i can't be accepting of other people i am fucking observant i know people a lot what they want what they want to hear what
and how to infuse those emotions in theory practice all of it...

And so be more open talk more to people show them sides you haven't shown vulnerability is like godly charm being vulnerable being you and 
letting people shine helping and if try to outsmart know how to bring them down...all this you can do and be done with it talking and all
not from the place of wanting love or something just boy girl tension that's all having jokes and banters and funs like that....

And as of who i want to be if that thought is colluded or is becoming benign then i want to be exceptionally good at language speaking expression
 humor wit charm...i feel i have charm i have wit i have humor but lacks framing and this common world practice witty humor and 
sarcastic one is the things i want , now that includes fantastic vocabulary fantastic pronunciation the facial expression the body language i feel 
shadow practice will do something really great things...and leaving a lasting impression of who i am....

second thing is having fun having calmness having sexual jokes poetry and reading tons of philosophy and movies that are famous and all of it not being
 afraid of the outcomes but being bold in my approach of life...and read the room really do it read how is it working and how to mold it in your favour 
 charmingly...either play the devil or play the hero but don't play with mediocrity...play stories with humor and wit..

and as your career be brutal fearless be Kobe in the work having set days for it that there will be only this character of me who will obsessively work 
like crazy think about it only and nothing else and then will create a distance from everything about who you are a curiosity a thing that will work like charm...

and as of your fashion be free and do it like you have made the plans and do some work some actual fucking coursework in ai/ml okay here is a deal complete
 10 chapters in Ian and complete those 4 courses and make the project will get you a piercing promise...ear one...
and a gold ring promise promise...and will get you something else maybe party or something...

and as of your pursuit every last weekend go out for party make new friends a lots of them and go out and have fun time of your life go to gym club and have 
couple of trustworthy close friends...
